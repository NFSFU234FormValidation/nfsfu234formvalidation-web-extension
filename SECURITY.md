## General Communication
- This extension ensures that user data is handled securely and does not collect any information without explicit user consent.

## 1. Secure Communication
- All communication between the NFSFU234FormValidation Browser Extension and external servers or APIs is encrypted using HTTPS.
- User input is thoroughly validated and sanitized to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

## 2. Permissions
- The extension requests only the necessary permissions for its functionality, minimizing the scope of access to user data.
- Permissions requested by the extension are regularly reviewed and updated to align with changes in functionality.

## 3. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- The extension implements a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which resources can be loaded.
- CSP directives, such as `script-src` and `connect-src`, are utilized to control script execution and network requests, enhancing security.

## 4. Secure Storage
- Sensitive data, such as user preferences or authentication tokens, is stored securely using Chrome storage APIs.
- Avoidance of client-side storage mechanisms like localStorage mitigates XSS vulnerabilities.

## 5. Input Validation and Sanitization
- Input from external sources, including user input and data from APIs, undergoes rigorous validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.

## 6. Updates and Vulnerability Management
- Dependencies and libraries used in the extension are regularly updated to patch known security vulnerabilities.
- Proactive monitoring of security advisories from relevant sources ensures prompt action against potential security threats.

## 7. Code Review and Testing
- Regular code reviews are conducted to identify and address security issues within the extension's codebase.
- Automated testing, including security testing like static analysis and vulnerability scanning, is employed to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities.

## 8. User Education
- Users are provided with clear information regarding the extension's permissions and data usage policies, promoting transparency and trust.
- Educational resources on common security threats, such as phishing attacks, equip users with the knowledge to safeguard their data and privacy.
